# Advent of Code 2022

[![CI](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/aoc-2022-deno/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jamesseanwright/aoc-2022-deno/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

My solutions to days 1-13 (bailing early as I don't want to spend the bulk of my
Christmas break staring at a computer screen LOL) of
[AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022), written in TypeScript and running on
Deno.

## Running the Solutions/Tests

```sh
$ deno test -A <day directory name> # runs the tests for a particular day e.g. deno test -A day01
$ deno test -A # runs all the tests for all completed days
```
